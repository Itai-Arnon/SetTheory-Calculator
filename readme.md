## Overview

This C program performs set theory operations such as union, symmetric difference, subtraction, and intersection. The program prompts the user to enter commands, which it then parses and executes using an abstract syntax tree (AST). If the syntax of the commands is incorrect, the program will render an error message.

## Features

- **Union**: Combines all elements from two sets.
- **Symmetric Difference**: Returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.
- **Subtraction**: Returns elements from the first set that are not in the second set.
- **Intersection**: Returns elements that are common to both sets.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and reports syntax errors in user commands.

## **Example input**

**read_set SETB,1,2,3,4,5,6,-1**  

**union_set SETA,SETB,SETC**  

**print_set SETC**  

**stop**
